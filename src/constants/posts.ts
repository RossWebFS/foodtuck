    description: `My intention is for this blog to chart my journey as I explore 
    this most diverse of food types, travelling around to find the greatest that 
    there is to offer, from the humble to the mighty. Along the way I plan on 
    bringing you my own experiments in burger recipes so that you can try them 
    for yourself, and explore the taste sensations that can be offered between sliced buns.
    As we delve deeper and deeper into the underbelly of the burger-beast we 
    will uncover the history of the burger, and try to replicate its past 
    iterations offering a view into the culinary fog of time.
    Two 3 1/2 ounce, short rib & chuck blend of @patlafrieda beef patties, 
    juicy and seasoned well with truffle salt. White American cheese, beautifully 
    melted, blankets both patties. Now here is where the flavor bomb hits you: 
    black summer truffles give you a little garlic taste. Decadent, foie gras 
    butter, is rich, fatty and buttery. They call their sauce, special sauce. 
    It has kewpie mayo, Dijon, ketchup and shallots. It’s delicious. 
    The truffles, foie gras butter and their special sauce along with 
    the white American cheese, and the fantastic beef blend, will make your 
    taste buds dance. You also get a few colorful, tasty bread & butter pickles.`,

    description: `Fat Tuesday is also known as Shrove Tuesday, or, Pancake Tuesday, 
    I’m sure you can already see where I’m going with this! Fat Tuesday 
    is known as an indulgent day when people traditionally eat rich, 
    fatty foods before the sacrifices and fasting made during the six 
    weeks of Lent before Easter. Because milk, butter, and eggs were 
    among the sacrifices during Lent, it makes sense that eating pancakes 
    became a staple of Fat Tuesday, and now Fat Tuesday is also National 
    Pancake Day – definitely a holiday to be celebrated in my book (I think my 
    little cousins would agree, and while this is an old picture, I just 
    love their smiles!). I was thrilled with the results, and I think you 
    will be, too. This is perfect for those of you that have multiple 
    pancake flavor preferences in your house, or if you’re living solo, 
    this is a great way to prep breakfast for the week while not having 
    to eat the same flavor profile day after day. This couldn’t be 
    easier to execute, and would be perfect for the littlest chefs 
    in your home to help create!`,

    description: `Chocolate. The very word makes me drool. I discovered this recipe 
    one day when i accidentally dropped some cocoa powder in a meringue mix. Instead 
    of removing it, I mixed it all up and voila! The chocolate meringue mountains 
    were born.. Since then I’ve made a few moderations, dusting with cocoa before 
    baking and drizzling with melted chocolate once cooled. I make meringue 
    following Darina Allens foolproof method: popping the egg whites and sugar 
    into a mixer and whisking until thick and glossy. Once cool, drizzle them with 
    with melted chocolate. (I put the chocolate into a Ziploc bag and seal, 
    then rest it in a bowl of hot water until melted and simply snip a tiny 
    bit off one of the corners to pipe)`,
